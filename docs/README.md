# BoundaryLine — Documentation Index

> All project documentation lives here. Start with `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the 10-minute overview, or `SETUP.md` to run the code locally.

## Reading Order

### I want to understand what BoundaryLine is
1. Root [`README.md`](../README.md) — pitch and quick start
2. [`GAME_DESIGN.md`](./GAME_DESIGN.md) — rules, point formula, tiers, strategy
3. [`TOKENOMICS.md`](./TOKENOMICS.md) — BNDY token design

### I want to build / run the code
1. [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md) — local environment, wallets, database
2. [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) — how pieces fit together
3. [`DATA_MODEL.md`](./DATA_MODEL.md) — database schema
4. [`API.md`](./API.md) — REST endpoints
5. [`CONTRACTS.md`](./CONTRACTS.md) — smart contract specs
6. [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md) — shipping to production

### I want to understand what we trust and why
1. [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) — threat model, trust assumptions, incident response
2. [`TOKENOMICS.md`](./TOKENOMICS.md#anti-abuse-guarantees) — anti-abuse mechanisms

### I want to know what's next
1. [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) — v1 → v2 → v3
2. Root [`PROJECT_TRACKER.md`](../PROJECT_TRACKER.md) — live task state

## Design Decisions At A Glance

All key decisions are captured in the root [`PROJECT_TRACKER.md`](../PROJECT_TRACKER.md) under **Key Decisions** with rationale and date.

The most important ones:

1. **Transferable ERC-20 + `earnedBalance` tracking** — lets the token trade freely without enabling pay-to-win
2. **Soulbound trophy NFTs** — achievement proof cannot be faked by buying
3. **Dual leaderboard** — off-chain global (engagement) + on-chain prize (authoritative)
4. **Off-chain gameplay, on-chain settlement** — zero gas to play, gas only to sync and claim
5. **Free to play, gas-only** — no entry fees, no tokenized entry, no money handling

## Open Questions

Tracked in [`PROJECT_TRACKER.md`](../PROJECT_TRACKER.md) under **Blockers** and **Notes**.

Current open items:
- Final prize list (pending mock images and copy)
- Whether to enable captain multipliers on Day 2 (stretch goal)
- Exact `MIN_EARNED_TO_CLAIM` value to use in demo (currently 10,000 — may tune based on simulated match data)
