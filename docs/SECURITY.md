# Security & Trust Model

> Honest accounting of what BoundaryLine trusts, what it doesn't, and the attack surface we care about.

---

## Trust Assumptions (plain English)

### What users must trust
1. **The backend signer** — it signs vouchers authorizing token mints. If compromised, an attacker could mint arbitrary BNDY to any wallet.
2. **The scoring engine** — points are calculated off-chain from match data. Users must trust we calculate them correctly.
3. **The match data source** — for v1 we manually enter match stats via an admin panel. Users must trust we enter accurate numbers.
4. **The DNS / Vercel deployment** — users must trust they're hitting the real `boundaryline.vercel.app`.

### What users do NOT need to trust
1. **Claim validity** — claims are cryptographically gated by the on-chain `earnedBalance >= 10,000 BNDY` check + signature verification. The backend cannot forge a claim without compromising the signer key.
2. **Trophy ownership** — trophies are soulbound ERC-721 tokens; once minted, they cannot be moved or revoked. The on-chain record is the truth.
3. **Leaderboard rank ordering** — reads `balanceOf` + `earnedBalance` directly from the contract via viem multicall. Rank positions cannot be faked by the backend — only the *filter* (qualification floor) and the *refresh schedule* are backend-controlled, and both are deterministic from contract state.
4. **Token custody** — users hold their own BNDY in their own wallet. The backend cannot move it.

### What BoundaryLine does NOT trust
1. **User input** — all API inputs are validated (Zod schemas on the server)
2. **Frontend code** — server never trusts values passed from the client for authoritative state; it always re-derives
3. **The chain for point calculations** — we calculate points ourselves, we don't rely on any on-chain oracle
4. **Admins for signer keys** — the signer key has a single job; admins cannot override it from the admin panel

## Threat Model

### Tier 1: Game-breaking attacks (must prevent)

> **Design context**: BoundaryLine ranks wallets by `balanceOf` and qualifies them by `earnedBalance`. Pay-to-rank is intentional; pure-whale and pay-to-claim are the two attack categories that must be blocked.

#### T1.1 — Pure-whale leaderboard takeover (zero-play rank capture)
**Attack**: Acquire a massive BNDY balance via DEX or transfer without ever playing, appear at Rank 1.
**Mitigation**: the leaderboard query filters to `earnedBalance >= 1,000 BNDY`. A wallet with zero `earnedBalance` is literally absent from the leaderboard response regardless of `balanceOf`. The snapshot table never inserts unqualified wallets.
**Status**: ✅ Mitigated in backend (leaderboard query) and enforced on-chain (earnedBalance read from contract, not DB — backend cannot fake it).
**Note**: This is a *weaker* mitigation than the original "earned-only" design, but it's intentional. Pay-to-rank is a feature; pure-whale is not.

#### T1.2 — Pay-to-claim (buy your way past the prize gate)
**Attack**: Earn the minimum 1,000 BNDY to appear on the leaderboard, then buy 50,000 BNDY on a DEX to climb into Top 10, then call `claimTier()`.
**Mitigation**: `claimTier()` enforces `earnedBalance >= MIN_EARNED_TO_CLAIM` where `MIN_EARNED_TO_CLAIM = 10,000 BNDY`. The purchased tokens count toward `balanceOf` (which determines rank) but contribute nothing to `earnedBalance`. The contract reverts the claim regardless of rank or wallet balance unless the attacker has personally earned 10k through real play.
**Status**: ✅ Mitigated in contract. The 10x gap between the leaderboard floor (1k) and the claim floor (10k) is the binding constraint.
**Worth restating**: an attacker *can* rank #1 on the leaderboard with bought tokens. They *cannot* convert that rank into a prize. This is the intended separation.

#### T1.3 — Signer key compromise
**Attack**: Steal the signer private key, mint unlimited BNDY to attacker wallets.
**Mitigation**:
- Key stored as Vercel env var, not in git
- Never logged
- Never transmitted to client
- Backend instance runs on Vercel Fluid Compute (isolated execution)
- Post-hackathon: rotate to HSM / KMS; v2: multi-party signing
**Status**: ⚠️ Accepted risk for hackathon. Single point of failure documented.

#### T1.4 — Voucher replay
**Attack**: Intercept a signed voucher and submit it multiple times.
**Mitigation**: `usedNonces` mapping in `PSLPoints`. Any submitted nonce is marked used in the same transaction; second submission reverts.
**Status**: ✅ Mitigated in contract.

#### T1.5 — Double-claim in one tournament
**Attack**: Claim a Top 10 prize, then claim Top 25 for the same wallet.
**Mitigation**: `claimTier()` resets `earnedBalance` to 0 and burns the full wallet. Subsequent claim attempts fail the `earnedBalance >= MIN` check unless the user re-earns 10k+ points through additional play. DB also enforces one active claim per wallet per tournament via unique index.
**Status**: ✅ Mitigated at both layers.

### Tier 2: Bad-actor attacks (serious, should prevent)

#### T2.1 — Sybil / wallet farming
**Attack**: Create 1000 wallets, earn tiny amounts in each, claim 1000 low-tier prizes.
**Mitigation**:
- `MIN_EARNED_TO_CLAIM = 10,000 BNDY` — requires meaningful play per wallet
- SIWE requires each wallet to actually exist and sign messages
- Future: rate limit team creation, add proof-of-humanity (captcha) in v2
**Status**: ⚠️ Partially mitigated. Determined attackers can still script multiple wallets but the minimum raises the cost substantially.

#### T2.2 — Admin panel credential theft
**Attack**: Steal `ADMIN_API_KEY` and submit fake match scores to manipulate points.
**Mitigation**:
- Key stored as env var, rotated after hackathon
- Admin endpoints logged
- Post-hackathon: replace with authenticated admin users + audit log
**Status**: ⚠️ Accepted risk for hackathon.

#### T2.3 — Match data manipulation (by the operator)
**Attack**: The team submits false match data, inflating points for favored players.
**Mitigation**:
- For hackathon: none, manual admin panel
- v2: Merkle commitment of match data published on-chain, allowing disputes
- v2: Integration with official PSL data feeds via Chainlink Functions
**Status**: ⚠️ Accepted risk. Documented openly.

#### T2.4 — Frontend phishing
**Attack**: Attacker hosts a copy of the BoundaryLine UI at a lookalike domain, captures signatures or sends malicious tx requests.
**Mitigation**:
- SIWE domain check (message includes domain, wallet rejects mismatches)
- Encourage users to bookmark the canonical URL
- Post-demo: apply for a `.eth` ENS + canonical domain
**Status**: ⚠️ Standard web3 UX risk. Not unique to BoundaryLine.

### Tier 3: Nuisance attacks (annoying, acceptable)

#### T3.1 — Front-running claims
**Attack**: Watch the mempool for a player's pending `claimTier()` tx, submit your own claim first to snag the last slot in a tier.
**Mitigation**:
- Claim vouchers are user-bound (`msg.sender` check) so you can't reuse someone else's voucher
- Stock is first-come, first-served at the DB level (slot reserved on voucher issue, not on tx submission)
- Backend only issues a voucher after confirming stock, so the slot is yours from the moment the voucher is signed
**Status**: ✅ Mitigated at the backend (stock reserved before voucher issue).

#### T3.2 — DoS on voucher signing
**Attack**: Spam `/api/sync` or `/api/claim` to exhaust backend CPU or Neon connections.
**Mitigation**:
- Post-hackathon: add rate limiting on `/api/sync`, `/api/claim`, `/api/auth/nonce`
- Vercel has a soft rate limit at the platform level
**Status**: ⚠️ Not mitigated in v1. Acceptable for hackathon.

#### T3.3 — RPC read flooding for the prize leaderboard
**Attack**: Hit `/api/leaderboard/prize` constantly to exhaust WireFluid RPC quota.
**Mitigation**:
- Snapshot cached in Postgres with a 30s staleness window
- Lazy refresh: only the first stale read triggers a multicall; subsequent reads within 30s return cached data
- Multicall batches `balanceOf` + `earnedBalance` for all tracked wallets into one RPC call
- Transfer-log scanning uses a `last_scanned_block` cursor, never rescans history
**Status**: ✅ Mitigated via cache + lazy refresh.

#### T3.4 — Unbounded tracked-wallet growth
**Attack**: Generate thousands of wallets and send dust transfers of BNDY to bloat the `tracked_wallet` table and slow the leaderboard refresh multicall.
**Mitigation**:
- Tracked wallets are filtered at refresh time: only wallets with `earnedBalance >= 1,000 BNDY` appear on the leaderboard
- Dust-receiver wallets are tracked but never rank, and the multicall cost per wallet is cheap (~1ms)
- v2: prune tracked wallets with zero activity across N consecutive refreshes
**Status**: ✅ Operationally acceptable at hackathon scale. Watch in production.

## Incident Response Plan

If something goes wrong during or after the hackathon demo:

### Mild (UI bug, slow leaderboard)
- Roll back the Vercel deployment
- Fix, redeploy
- No on-chain action needed

### Moderate (backend issuing incorrect vouchers)
- Pause the admin panel (disable `ADMIN_API_KEY`)
- Identify scope of incorrect mints by scanning DB + chain events
- Document discrepancies
- Communicate to users: which mints were invalid, whether claims need to be revoked
- There is no on-chain rollback — communicate and compensate off-chain

### Severe (signer key compromised)
- Immediately rotate the env var (invalidates future vouchers)
- Cannot invalidate already-issued vouchers — any nonces already in `usedNonces[]` will still work if submitted
- Announce to users
- Take the site down until a new signer wallet is wired up
- v2 architectural fix: make `trustedSigner` upgradeable via admin multisig (sacrifices some trustlessness for operational safety)

### Catastrophic (contract bug allowing arbitrary mint or theft)
- The contracts are immutable, no pause function in v1 → **cannot fix on-chain**
- Mitigation: launch a new contract version, ask users to migrate, deprecate the old one
- v2: consider adding a pause function for emergencies (`Ownable` + `Pausable` from OZ)

## What's Explicitly Out Of Scope

These are NOT mitigated in v1, and we're documenting that openly:

- **Formal verification** of the contracts (too heavy for a hackathon)
- **External audit** by a professional firm (too expensive and slow)
- **Timelock governance** on admin actions
- **Decentralized oracle** for match data
- **Multi-sig** on signer and admin operations
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** for privacy-preserving rank claims
- **Upgradeability** (contracts are immutable by design for simplicity)

All in [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md).

## Responsible Disclosure

If you find a vulnerability, please report to the team privately. Do not open a public issue.

For the hackathon, just message the team. Post-hackathon, if the project continues, we'll set up a `security@` email and a bounty program.
