| Area           | State                                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Docs (spec)    | ✅ Complete                                                                       |
| Monorepo infra | ✅ Scaffolded                                                                     |
| Contracts      | ✅ Deployed + verified on WireFluid testnet                                       |
| DB schema      | ✅ Migrated + seeded on live Neon (150 players, 5 tiers, 1 tournament, 3 matches) |
| Shared pkg     | ✅ Authored (chain, ABIs, DTOs, vouchers, constants)                              |
| API routes     | ✅ Core auth/gameplay/dashboard routes shipped                                    |
| Frontend       | ⚠️ Landing + dashboard shipped; remaining app pages pending                       |
| Deployment     | ⚠️ Contracts live; Vercel app deploy pending                                      |
| Demo artifacts | ⚠️ Transactions log partially filled; demo run pending                            |

**Suggested build order:** contracts → DB schema + seeds → shared types/ABIs → API routes → frontend pages (parallel) → deploy → demo transactions.
